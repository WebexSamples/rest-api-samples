# Webex REST API Sample Code > Meetings > CRUD

This directory contains sample code demonstrating a JavaScript implementation of a REST client that calls the Meetings API to create a meeting, reads the details of that created meeting, updates that meeting, and finally deletes it. The journey can be observed by reading the output of `console.log()` in the terminal.

## Get a Token

See `Get a Token` in the main [/README.md](../../README.md)

## Run the code

This sample is JS, intended to be run via Node:

`node ./run_crud.js`

At the time of writing, we're using the latest LTS release of Node.
