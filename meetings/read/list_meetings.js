 * READ (list) meetings in Webex with the REST API in Node
 * https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/meetings/list-meetings
 *
 * Step 0: Have a (free) Webex account: https://cart.webex.com/sign-up
 * Step 1: Log in to https://developer.webex.com/login
 * Step 2: Find your bearer token at
 *         https://developer.webex.com/docs/getting-started under "Your
 *         Personal Access Token" in the middle of the page.
 * Step 3: Replace the string on the line that defines const myWebexDeveloperToken,
 *         just below, with your personal bearer (access) token. Hit "save".
 * Step 4: Run this file with node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 *         from within this directory on the command line:
 *
 *         node ./list_meetings.js
 *
 * Step 5: Profit. Get your app listed in the Webex App Hub!
 *         https://apphub.webex.com/
